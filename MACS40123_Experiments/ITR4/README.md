- [extract_text.py](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/extract_text.py) and [extract_text.sbatch](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/extract_text.sbatch) files are used to extract text from images with OCR packages.  

- [encoding.py](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/encoding.py) and [encoding.sbatch](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/encoding.sbatch) use a pre-trained model to embed combined text (text extracted from images, title, and comments) to vectors.

- [diversity_trial.ipynb](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/diversity_trial.ipynb) shows the exploration of the trend of different types of content diversity, such as the distance of all pairs within one month, the distance of all pairs within three month, and the distance between current instances with all historical instances.

- [relationship.ipynb](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/relationship.ipynb) shows the process of correlation analysis and the construction of different linear regression models.

- [arimax.ipynb](https://github.com/MaoYingrong/MEMEs_culture_evolution/blob/main/MACS40123_Experiments/ITR4/arimax.ipynb) shows the experiments on ARIMAX models.
